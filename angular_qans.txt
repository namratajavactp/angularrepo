1) for which kind of applications angular is not fit for?
Games and GUI editors are examples of applications with intensive and tricky DOM manipulation. These kinds of apps are different from CRUD apps, and as a result are probably not a good fit for Angular. In these cases it may be better to use a library with a lower level of abstraction, such as jQuery.

3)
While straightforward, this method will not work with JavaScript minifiers/obfuscators as they rename the method parameter names. This makes this way of annotating only useful for pretotyping, and demo applications.

function MyController($scope, greeter) {
  // ...
}
https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/di

angular.module('myModule', [])
  .factory('serviceId', ['depService', function(depService) {
    ...
  }])
  .directive('directiveName', ['depService', function(depService) {
    ...
  }])
  .filter('filterName', ['depService', function(depService) {
    ...
  }]);


what does this mean?
someModule.controller('MyController', ['$scope', 'dep1', 'dep2', function($scope, dep1, dep2) {
  ...
  $scope.aMethod = function() {
    ...
  }
  ...
}]);
This avoids the creation of global functions for controllers and also protects against minification.
